        <h2 id="programming-languages-theory-and-practice">Programming Languages: Theory and Practice</h2>
<p>(<em>CIS 352</em> at Syracuse U)</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: parts of this syllabus are subject to change with adequate
notice to students.</p>

<p>An introduction to the design and implementation of programming
languages, focused on operational semantics and interpreters. This
course is heavily project-focused, and a specific emphasis will be
placed upon training in algorithmic thinking and programming strategy.</p>

<p><b>Instructors:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Kris Micinski, Asst. Prof at Syracuse ECS
    <ul>
      <li>Office hours for <strong>programming-related</strong> questions: Wednesday,
1:30 to 3:30 in room CST 4-185</li>
      <li>Office hours, 5min questions or less (no debugging help): 30min after class</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Neda Abdolrahimi, teaching assistant
    <ul>
      <li>Office hours TBA</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Workload</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Asynchronous video lecture units (at most ~80min per week)
    <ul>
      <li>I assume you have watched the videos before class; but no 
pressure to understand everything, I will recap during
class. However, please think of recorded lectures as “the book.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>4 projects</li>
  <li>5 programming exercises</li>
  <li>~4-6 “handouts” (worth 2% each)</li>
  <li>2 midterms, second is the last day of class. There is <em>no final</em> (i.e., no exam during the scheduled final period).</li>
  <li>This will be a <em>project-heavy</em> course. Approximately 3-5 hours per
week outside of class is expected. I recommend against taking this
course concurrent with other project-heavy courses.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="course-tags">Course Tags</h5>

<p>The university recommends instructors label their courses with <a href="https://effectiveness.syr.edu/shared-competencies/">shared competencies</a>. We intend for this course to fit the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Critical and Creative Thinking</li>
  <li>Scientific Inquiry and Research Skills</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="wednesday-debugging-hours-instructor-led">Wednesday debugging hours (instructor led)</h5>

<p>The professor will be available on Wednesdays, from 1:30PM to 3:30PM.
Please plan to take either a five, 10, or 15-minute block. If you
plan to take more than 15 minutes, you may be asked to share time with
other students.</p>

<p>This time is for debugging and to get critique on your code
style. Please be mindful of the collaboration policy below–it is fine
to watch along in office hours, but be careful not to use it as a
crutch to develop your own solution.</p>

<p>I will try to avoid canceling Wednesday debugging
hours. Unfortunately, sometimes I may get busy on Wednesdays with
research-related work or deadlines from other service obligations. In
the event I do need to cancel, I will let you know as far in advance
as I can. Please email me to set up additional extra office hours in
this event, I am eager to meet.</p>

<h5 id="after-class-office-hours">After-class office hours</h5>

<p>The professor will generally make himself available for up to 30
minutes after class. Please avoid asking code related questions at the
end of lecture, especially because there is another class that enters
directly after ours. This would be a good time to come if you have
content-related questions that can be addressed at the whiteboard or
just via talking, without looking at your code.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Exams – 40%</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Two midterms. Midterm 1 will be partially before the mid-point, and
 midterm 2 (the “final”) will be on the last day of class. Each exam
 is worth 20%. Focus topics will be announced via electronic
 announcement (e.g., on Slack) a day or two before the
 exam. Students are allowed a handwritten, one-sided, US
 letter-sized note sheet.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Both exams are comprehensive, and a study guide will be provided
several days before the scheduled exam.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For the first exam (but <em>NOT</em> the second, due to time constraints)
students will be allowed to submit corrections which will allow
them to get back up to 50% of their missed points. For example, if
a student gets a 50% on their exam, and they successfully submit
corrections, they will receive a mark of 75%. We will specify in
detail what is required the day we return the first midterm.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Autograder Projects – 40%</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>4 individual programming projects worth 10% each.
        <ul>
          <li>Collaboration/ChatGPT/… IS NOT allowed on projects. See the AI usage policy below.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Autograder Exercises – 10%</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>5 Autograder-based programming exercises, worth 2% each.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Working in groups (up to three) is <strong>explicitly allowed</strong>, however:</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It is required that all work on exercises be conducted
together. It is <strong>not</strong> acceptable for one groupmate to do the
work without others present and have others submit. It is also
acceptable to work alone (or in a group of two).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Collaboration/ChatGPT/… IS allowed on exercises</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It IS NOT permissible to share your coding exercise solutions
with classmates outside of your group.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Handouts/Homework – 10%</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>There will be (at most) 5 “handouts”/homework assignments weighted
equally, these will mostly occur in the later part of the course.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>These assignments will be either (a) handed out in class or (b)
completed on Blackboard. Copies will be distributed online for
students not present in class. Deadlines will be set on a
per-assignment basis.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bonus Points – Up to 4%</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>I will offer several <em>bonus</em> handouts / exercises. These will take
various forms. For example, one is a history writeup about the
lambda calculus which requires you to write a paragraph or
two. These will be announced in class, please ask for details if
you are unsure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="final-letter-grading-bars">Final letter grading bars</h4>

<p>Final grades will be assigned as follows. A small “bump” (0-2 points
usually) will likely be given in practice, but is not guaranteed–this
will be announced at the end of the course, though I will try to
provide a ballpark estimate on Slack before the second midterm.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A  – 92%</li>
  <li>A-  – 90%</li>
  <li>B+ – 87%</li>
  <li>B  – 83%</li>
  <li>B- – 78%</li>
  <li>C+ – 74%</li>
  <li>C  – 70%</li>
  <li>C- – 65%</li>
  <li>D  – 60%</li>
  <li>&lt; D – &lt; 60%</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="topics">Topics</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Functional programming in Racket/Scheme</li>
  <li>Forms and callsites</li>
  <li>Lexical environments and scoping</li>
  <li>Textual reduction semantics</li>

  <li>Overview of more advanced compilation topics: instruction selection,

</ul>

<h4 id="autograder-exercises--projects-50">Autograder Exercises / Projects (50%)</h4>

<p>There are <em>four individual programming projects</em> in Racket.  Projects
will be graded using an <em>autograder</em> whose URL is
<a href="https://autograde.org">https://autograde.org</a>. You will receive
credentials for the autograder–if you have not received these by the
second week of class, let the professor know. You are expected to
learn how to use the Git interface to the autograder–the autograder
will technically accept archives, but the instructors strongly prefer
students (and will exclusively help support) using Git. Again, you
<em>must learn Git to use the autograder</em>.</p>

<p>There will also be between four and six <em>group programming exercises</em>
in Racket. These exercises may be done in groups of up to three
students. Groups <em>MUST</em> write their solution together (Zoom/video call
is acceptable, but it must be synchronous).</p>

<p>Exercises and projects will be weighted at point values of 100 points
(exercises) and 1000 points (projects), so that projects are worth
roughly 10x as much as exercises. Exact grading weights on the
autograder are subject to change pending sufficient notice to
students, but will never be more work (or less advantageous to
students) than the grading bars specified here.</p>

<h5 id="project--exercise-late-policy">Project / Exercise Late Policy</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Projects and exercises turned in within 72 hours of the deadline
will receive a 15 percent penalty. Projects turned in after 72 hours
and until the end of the course will receive a 25 percent penalty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will <strong>NOT</strong> grant one-off project extensions without good
reason. There is a liberal late policy. I encourage you to take the
15% off and submit late–many projects will have bonus points that
will allow you to raise your grade and offset late submissions, and
a single late submission will likely not change your final course
grade.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am happy to move project deadlines for religious observances,
excused medical absence, and similar unforeseen
circumstances. Please email me and we can discuss a satisfactory
resolution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="exams-40">Exams (40%)</h4>

<p>Exams explicitly measure your ability to materialize solutions to
questions regarding relevant course content in an open-ended
fashion. There will be two midterms. Questions will be drawn from the
learning objectives at the top of the page. I will release a practice
exam several days before both midterms, which we will work through in
class.</p>

<p>After the first midterm, you may submit corrections for up to 50% of
missed points back. Details will be provided after the first
midterm. There will be no corrections for the second midterm.</p>

<p>We realize exams can be stressful. The instructors strongly encourage
students to look into the resources provided by the Barnes Center
(such as extended exam time) if a student thinks their academic
performance is impeded by exam-related stress. We are happy to provide
accomodations for exams, but the instructors request at least 72 hours
notice for each exam so that we may upload the necessary material to
the student testing center.</p>

<h4 id="final-group-project-10">Final Group Project (10%)</h4>

<p>The final group project will involve roughly the same amount of work
as the harder individual projects (projects 3/4). However, the project
will be completed in a group, and pair programming will be
specifically required. The project will likely involve a portion of a
compiler. The instructor will show / build a significant portion of
the solution in class, but your group is expected to debug and fix
issues to complete the assignment.</p>

<p>Grading will be separate from Autograder grading–we may use a
separate autograder instance, or grade in an ad-hoc way. We plan to
put the vast bulk of the grade on the objective score (from testcases,
as in the individual projects)–however, we may also add some amount
of peer assessment.</p>

<h4 id="collaboration-and-the-honor-code">Collaboration and the Honor Code</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Projects and exams must be completed alone, without exception.</li>
  <li>Specifically, you must <em>never</em> send your code to anyone or allow
anyone to watch you code, obtain your code, study your code, copy
your code, etc… We expect you will take reasonable precautious to
ensure the secrecy of your solutions (e.g., closing your laptop
before leaving your apartment, if living with other students).</li>
  <li>The autograder employs elaborate cheat-detection techniques,
including advanced static analyses. These techniques will compare
your code to other students’ submissions, along with students from
previous semesters. The TAs and instructor will be using these
features to periodically scan for students who are cheating. Past
experience shows us that this system is very robust, and has allowed
us to detect several large clusters of collaborating students; all
violations ever reported in CIS352 have been upheld by the Syracuse
University academic integrity council.</li>
  <li>All apparent cases (with credible evidence, as determined by lead
instructor) of academic dishonesty will be reported, even if the
student believes they made an honest mistake, or no mistake at
all. We understand honor violations are stressful processes, and
thus we strive to only submit academic integrity cases when we
believe there is clear evidence that the academic integrity board
should review our findings independently.</li>
  <li>You may collaborate, to any degree you want, with anyone (even
outside of your group) on in-class or self-study exercises. These
will be clearly labeled, and are specifically not the course
projects (which explicitly disallow any form of collaboration).</li>
  <li>While we recommend you discuss the project specification with your
peers, you should basically never be getting help from peers about
your code. In particular, you should never be showing another
student your project code. If you do discuss coding about the
project with another student, it should only be in the abstract
(e.g., “can you use operator overloading to implement that?” or “do
you think it would be sensible to implement this with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">map</code>?”) and
not particularized to your codebase. We understand that this can be
a challenging line to walk, and thus, we recommend the following
heuristic: when talking to other students about code, discuss mostly
the in-class exercises and participation coding exercises.</li>
  <li>You may not “hard code” solutions to tests for projects. The TAs and
professor will audit all student solutions, and use automated static
analysis tools, to check for potential hard-coding or other
practices that circumvent the spirit of our automated
tests–hard-coding solutions is considered a particularly offensive
violation and will be immediately reported to the academic integrity
board.</li>
  <li>Cite all help other than the professor, T.A., and
required/recommended text (you are allowed to cite those if you
wish, but it is not required unless you are specifically told
otherwise). Proper citation is not sufficient to avoid any charge of
academic dishonesty (e.g., citing another student’s work from a
previous semester), but we will not be particularly focused on
copyright law and it is permissible to use small snippets of code
from Stack Overflow (or related sources such as books and notes)
that do not tangibly complete the substance of the project for you.
<strong>Again</strong>: You should <strong>never</strong> share code with another
student. This includes both sending a file to another student and
“over the shoulder” copying (even when, e.g., variable names are
changed, etc..). In the eyes of the instructor, these are both
equally bad. You should never be sitting and helping another along
by writing their code. By doing so you are both violating the honor
policy and disadvanting the student you are helping (as they may not
then properly learn the material).</li>
  <li>If a student is found (by the university academic integrity council)
to have violated the academic integrity policy, the instructor
reserves the right to impose any grade-related sanction they see
fit, up to and including course failure–regardless of the level
suggested by the academic integrity council.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="official-ai-policy">Official AI policy</h2>

<p>Per university policy, I am required to use university-provided
language, thus, here is the <strong>official</strong> class AI policy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on the specific learning outcomes and assignments in this
course, artificial intelligence is permitted on the following:
autograder exercises (<strong>NOT</strong> projects), which are clearly labeled and
worth 2% each. See each assignment, quiz, or exam instructions for
more information about what artificial intelligence tools are
permitted and to what extent, as well as citation requirements. If no
instructions are provided for a specific assignment, then no use of
any artificial intelligence tool is permitted. Any AI use beyond that
which is detailed in course assignments is explicitly prohibited
except when documented permission is granted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following is an informal justification for my policy as it relates
to the class, CIS352, giving more context:</p>

<p>Large Language Models and similar machine-learning-based tools have
the potential to radically change the way in which humans perform
their work. The course instructor does research in AI and understands
the value in using ChatGPT and similar tools to help learn and study
(henceforth we casually conflate ChatGPT and similar LLM-based
tools). However, these tools should be used carefully, and never in a
way that undermines the spirit of expending genuine mental energy to
understand the material in the class. I (the instructor) have used
ChatGPT myself for quick answers to routine tasks, particularly in
shell scripting and usage of common development tools. However, I do
not find ChatGPT sufficient in serious work–I have found the code and
writing it produces is often immature at best, and downright incorrect
at worst. It can be challenging for newcomers to tell the difference
between these, and thus while I do recommend considering ChatGPT as
part of your problem-solving toolbucket.</p>

<p>I recommend the following guidelines (consistent with the official
university-provided text above) for this class, CIS352. In the
following “ChatGPT” refers to all tools based upon generative AI:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Usage of ChatGPT is permitted to help study and understand material
from class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Usage of ChatGPT is permitted on programming exercises–but not
projects–provided that students provide the prompt they used in a
comment and are honest about their usage of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may not submit any code generated by ChatGPT for programming
projects, but you may look at the output of ChatGPT and use it to
inspire your own solution with regards to small helper functions. I
have tried each of the programming projects in this class using
ChatGPT myself, and I also do research in program synthesis using
symbolic methods: I can confidently say that ChatGPT cannot yet
solve the course projects, and when I tried to use it to do so it
led me down a path to deeply broken code that would confuse any
student. There are code-oriented language models (e.g., Facebook’s
Code Llama or GitHub’s Copilot) which do slightly better (albeit
without an easy-to-use interface), but still do not work for the
course projects because there is not a sufficient corpus of Racket
available to train from.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because you may not submit any ChatGPT-generated code in project
submissions, it is specifically <em>not acceptable to say that you
submitted the same code as another student because it was generated
by ChatGPT</em>. Duplicate <em>project</em> submissions (officially
disallowed), even those due to identical outputs of ChatGPT, will be
considered honor code violations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="slackemail-policy">Slack/Email Policy</h2>

<p>Please keep all questions related to course projects and policies on
Slack–I use Slack quite a bit more than email, and only check email a
few times a day. Note that FERPA requirements prohibit me from
discussing precise grades on Slack–for <em>any</em> question related to
course records, please use email instead.</p>

<p>For official business (notifications of course absence due to illness,
or similar extenuating circumstances, etc…) please email me. I will
work to acknowledge emails within 24 hours. I sometimes miss emails
due to the large volume of email I receive; please feel free to email
me again after 24 hours if you have not received an answer and I will
get back to you as quickly as I can.</p>

<p>Please do not ask for extensions over email or Slack unless you
believe you have an approved accomodation–there is a blanket late
policy in place which takes precedent here, and the Autograder does
not allow one-off project extensions.</p>

<h2 id="student-support">Student Support</h2>

<p>Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed
to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be
aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in
barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I
invite any student to contact me to discuss strategies and/or
accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your
success and to collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources
(CDR) in this process.</p>

<h2 id="accreditation-and-use-of-student-work">Accreditation and Use of Student Work</h2>

<p>As part of the regular ABET accreditation process for the
undergraduate program in computer science, we may be collecting
samples of students’ work in each of our undergraduate classes.  As a
result, some of your labs/homeworks/exams may be photocopied/scanned
(or electronically copied) to be presented for accreditation at some
later point.</p>

<h2 id="faith-tradition-observances">Faith Tradition Observances</h2>

<p>Syracuse University’s Religious Observances Policy
(https://policies.syr.edu/policies/university-governance-ethics-integrity-and-legal-compliance/religious-observances-policy/)
recognizes the diversity of faiths represented in the campus community
and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe
religious holy days according to their traditions. Under the policy,
students are given an opportunity to make up any examination, study,
or work requirements that may be missed due to a religious observance,
provided they notify their instructors no later than the academic drop
deadline. For observances occurring before the drop deadline,
notification is required at least two academic days in
advance. Students may enter their observances in MySlide under Student
Services/Enrollment/My Religious Observances/Add a Notification.</p>

<h2 id="student-mental-health">Student Mental Health</h2>

<p>Mental health and overall well-being are significant predictors of
academic success. As such it is essential that during your college
experience you develop the skills and resources effectively to
navigate stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health
concerns. Please familiarize yourself with the range of resources the
Barnes Center provides (https://ese.syr.edu/bewell) and seek out
support for mental health concerns as needed. Counseling services are
available 24/7, 365 days a year, at 315.443.8000.</p>

<h2 id="discrimination-and-harassment">Discrimination and Harassment</h2>

<p>The University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or
discrimination related to any protected category including creed,
ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex,
gender, pregnancy, disability, marital status, age, race, color,
veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation,
domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender
expression or perceived gender.</p>

<p>Any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these
protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the
University’s Chief Equal Opportunity &amp; Title IX Officer. She is
responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under various laws
including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, Inclusion, and

<p>If you notice any incidents of harassment or discrimination in class
or related venues (Zulip, other chats with students), however minor,
please email me. You may wish to use an anonymous email service such
as https://anonymousemail.me/. Please feel free to tell me as much as
you feel comfortable.  As a notice: I am a mandatory Title IX reporter
